# DINO Paper Reconstruction with ResNet-50 and ImageNet

## What?
Reconstruction of https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294. Nothing particularly original. Trained on a much smaller dataset (ImageNette) and acheived better than random results :)
Done in a group as part of the Neuromatch group - see the original repo for the other group members.
## Why?
To learn the ideas in the paper (unsupervised learning of image classification is very cool!)... distillation, resnets, basic deep learning ideas.
